# Counter Smart Contract – Monad Testnet

A simple Solidity smart contract built and deployed as part of **Assignment-3** for the **Monad-101 Speedrun (Hyderabad)**.

This project demonstrates basic Solidity concepts and contract deployment using **Remix IDE** on the **Monad testnet**.

---

## 📌 Contract Overview

The `Counter` contract stores a single `uint256` value called `count` and provides functions to update it.

### Features

- Store a public counter value on-chain
- Increment the counter by 1
- Decrement the counter by 1
- Set the counter to a custom value

---

## 🧠 Smart Contract Code

- Language: Solidity `^0.8.24`
- IDE: Remix
- Network: Monad Testnet

Core concepts used:

- State variables
- Public visibility
- Functions
- Basic arithmetic operations

---

## 🔧 Functions

### `count() → uint256`

Returns the current counter value.

### `increment()`

Increases the counter by 1.

### `decrement()`

Decreases the counter by 1.

### `setCount(uint256 _newCount)`

Sets the counter to a new value provided by the user.
